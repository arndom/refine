chore: update `@ant-design/icons` version to match `@refinedev/antd`.

This is a patch release to update the `@ant-design/icons` version to match the `@refinedev/antd` version. Previously `@ant-design/icons` were pinned to `5.0.1` version to avoid conflicts with `React@18` and `@ant-design/pro-layout` packages. After `5.4.0` these issues are resolved and we can safely update the version to latest range.
